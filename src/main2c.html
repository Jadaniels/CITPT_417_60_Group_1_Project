                            <p>
                                When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank 
                                Baum's classic tale, we heard only her side of the story. But what about 
                                her arch-nemesis, the mysterious witch? Where did she come from? How did 
                                she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?
                                Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will 
                                never look at Oz the same way again. Wicked is about a land where animals 
                                talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders 
                                seek the comfort of middle-class stability and the Tin Man comes a 
                                victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned 
                                girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to be the infamous Wicked Witch of 
                                the West, a smart, prickly and misunderstood creature who challenges all 
                                our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.

                                Great read, but recommended for more advanced readers due to the 
                                graphic content and concepts.  Heart wrecking at times and makes you 
                                root for the underdog.  
                            </p>

                                Wicked is one of several alternate stories 
                                by Gregory Maguire.  The overall story is similar to Wicked Witch of 
                                the West, but from the viewpoint of the Wicked Witch, Elphaba.  
                                Wicked is a wonderful book illustrating the drastic difference 
                                between "beautiful" people and others.  While the original story 
                                highlights the harsh treatment to Dorothy and her travels to get home.  
                                Wicked shows mistreatment, bulling, and loneliness that Elphaba faced 
                                by her family and those around her.  Her mother who took shady medicine 
                                prior to giving birth afflicted Elphaba with deformity.  Her isolation 
                                drove her to create her only friends, the flying monkeys that Dorothy 
                                and party promptly hurt and kill.  She is deprived of her birthright, 
                                the ruby slippers that are emotionally connected to her sister 
                                Nessarose.  Elphaba is shown to be a highly intelligent person striving 
                                for equal rights for the people.  She is harassed and targeted by those 
                                around her due to her looks and beliefs.

                                All the creatures of the night gather in "the Hollows" of Cincinnati, 
                                to hide, to prowl, to party . . . and to feed.
                                Vampires rule the darkness in a predator-eat-predator world rife with 
                                dangers beyond imaginingâ€”and it's Rachel Morgan's job to keep that 
                                world civilized.
                                A bounty hunter and a witch with serious sex appeal and an attitude, 
                                she'll bring 'em back alive, dead . . . or undead.

                                Thrilling rollercoaster of activity.  Recommended for adult readers 
                                due to sexual content and graphic imagery.  Many books in the series 
                                that will keep you entertained.

                                Dead Witch Walking drew me in due to 
                                the all titles of the series being takes from movie titles.  This one 
                                being Dead Man Walking.  Some of the other book titles are The Good, 
                                The Bad, and The Undead and Every Which Way But Dead.   Dead Witch 
                                Walking introduces us to Rachel Morgan.  A stubborn, sexy red-hair 
                                witch that works for law enforcement.  She wants out of the corrupted 
                                police department.  With the help of Eve, a blonde, frigid vampire and 
                                Jenks, a four-inch pixie they venture out to be bounty hunters.  Along 
                                the way to earning freedom from buying their way out of the police force,
                                 they take on Trent, a possible drug dealer posing as prominent 
                                 businessperson.  All the while, Rachel and Eve are conflicted as they 
                                 share more than blood.
