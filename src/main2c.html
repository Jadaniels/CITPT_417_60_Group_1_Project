                            <p>
                                When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank 
                                Baum's classic tale, we heard only her side of the story. But what about 
                                her arch-nemesis, the mysterious witch? Where did she come from? How did 
                                she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?
                                Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will 
                                never look at Oz the same way again. Wicked is about a land where animals 
                                talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders 
                                seek the comfort of middle-class stability and the Tin Man becomes a 
                                victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned 
                                girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to be the infamous Wicked Witch of 
                                the West, a smart, prickly and misunderstood creature who challenges all 
                                our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.

                                A wonderful retelling of what happens when an author takes creative 
                                licensing to a story.  The story entices you to read more and follow 
                                on to the remaining of the series where maybe Queen Redd is not as bad 
                                of a person you thought she was.

                                I was very intrigued by The Looking 
                                Glass Wars.  The cover and artwork is reminisce to Star Wars.  Alyss 
                                is heir to the throne and escapes the castle through the Pool of Tears 
                                into London when her aunt lays siege.  She is alone and is taking in 
                                by a family and her story is changed to a fairy tale for all to read.  
                                While those around her brainwash her that it is all a dream, her 
                                comrades’ fight a rebellion for her kingdom.  Her retainer, Hatter 
                                Madigan searches the world to find Alyss after being separated in transit.   Dodge, the son of the original captain of the palace guards along with General Doppelgänger create the Alyssian rebellion.  They struggle for thirteen years battling against Queen Redd and The Cat until Alyss and Madigan return to take the throne back.  Deception, loss, and finally resolution are gained, as Alyss becomes the “Warrior-Queen” to rule Wonderland.

                                All the creatures of the night gather in "the Hollows" of Cincinnati, 
                                to hide, to prowl, to party . . . and to feed.
                                Vampires rule the darkness in a predator-eat-predator world rife with 
                                dangers beyond imagining—and it's Rachel Morgan's job to keep that 
                                world civilized.
                                A bounty hunter and a witch with serious sex appeal and an attitude, 
                                she'll bring 'em back alive, dead . . . or undead.

                                Thrilling rollercoaster of activity.  Recommended for adult readers 
                                due to sexual content and graphic imagery.  Many books in the series 
                                that will keep you entertained.

                                Dead Witch Walking drew me in due to 
                                the all titles of the series being takes from movie titles.  This one 
                                being Dead Man Walking.  Some of the other book titles are The Good, 
                                The Bad, and The Undead and Every Which Way But Dead.   Dead Witch 
                                Walking introduces us to Rachel Morgan.  A stubborn, sexy red-hair 
                                witch that works for law enforcement.  She wants out of the corrupted 
                                police department.  With the help of Eve, a blonde, frigid vampire and 
                                Jenks, a four-inch pixie they venture out to be bounty hunters.  Along 
                                the way to earning freedom from buying their way out of the police force,
                                 they take on Trent, a possible drug dealer posing as prominent 
                                 businessperson.  All the while, Rachel and Eve are conflicted as they 
                                 share more than blood.
