                                This novel, by Ruta Sepetys, is set in the USSR during the early years of WW2. The story is told through the eyes of a 15 year old teen named Lina.  Her life was normal until her entire family was sent to a prison camp in Siberia. Her new life is to survive and record her story and the stories of other prisoners through art snd writing. The writing, world building, and character building are all excellent. If you like WW2 stories then I highly recommend reading this wonderful novel. <br> <strong>Score: 4/5</strong> <br> Here's the <a href="http://www.betweenshadesofgray.com/index.php">link</a> to the author's website if you want to learn more or make a purchase.

                                A story full of death set in 1928 Germany, is fittingly narrated by Death itself.  The story follows a young girl as she falls in love with books and the power of the written word.  Liesel forms a special relationship with a librarian that helps her save books from the Nazis. <br> <strong>Score: 4/5</strong> <br> Here's a <a href="http://www.betweenshadesofgray.com/index.php">link</a> to the book on Amazon. There is also a movie adaptation.  Be warned, critic reviews of the movie would suggest the book is much more suited for telling this story, but it may be worth a watch if you really enjoyed the book.
