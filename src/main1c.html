                                Cinder is the first of a series of books by Marissa 
                                Meyer.  It is a different take of the popular Cinderella story.  
                                The story is set in an alternative universe similar to ours.  
                                Magic and technology is present.  Magic being used by Lunar people 
                                while Earth people rely on technology.  The world as post-apocalyptic 
                                with a large divide between the “haves” and “haves not”.  Cinder is an 
                                enduring tomboy that captures your heart.  She is faced with a horrible 
                                family life with her younger sister and artificial intelligent robot 
                                being her only comfort.  In the beginning of the story, she is enamored 
                                by a young man and throughout the story the plot is expanded across the 
                                globe.  Her involvement exposes political secrets, government 
                                conspiracies, and an adventure that keeps you wanting to read more.

                                The Myth: Alice was an ordinary girl who stepped through the looking glass 
                                and entered a fairy-tale world invented by Lewis Carroll in his famous 
                                storybook. The Truth: Wonderland is real. Alyss Heart is the heir to the 
                                throne, until her murderous aunt Redd steals the crown and kills Alyss? 
                                parents. To escape Redd, Alyss and her bodyguard, Hatter Madigan, must flee 
                                to our world through the Pool of Tears. But in the pool Alyss and Hatter 
                                are separated. Lost and alone in Victorian London, Alyss is befriended by 
                                an aspiring author to whom she tells the violent, heartbreaking story of 
                                her young life. Yet he gets the story all wrong. Hatter Madigan knows the 
                                truth only too well, and he is searching every corner of our world to find 
                                the lost princess and return her to Wonderland so she may battle Redd for 
                                her rightful place as the Queen of Hearts.

                                Great read, but recommended for more advanced readers due to the 
                                graphic content and concepts.  Heart wrecking at times and makes you 
                                root for the underdog.

                                Wicked is one of several alternate stories 
                                by Gregory Maguire.  The overall story is similar to Wicked Witch of 
                                the West, but from the viewpoint of the Wicked Witch, Elphaba.  
                                Wicked is a wonderful book illustrating the drastic difference 
                                between “beautiful” people and others.  While the original story 
                                highlights the harsh treatment to Dorothy and her travels to get home.  
                                Wicked shows mistreatment, bulling, and loneliness that Elphaba faced 
                                by her family and those around her.  Her mother who took shady medicine 
                                prior to giving birth afflicted Elphaba with deformity.  Her isolation 
                                drove her to create her only friends, the flying monkeys that Dorothy 
                                and party promptly hurt and kill.  She is deprived of her birthright, 
                                the ruby slippers that are emotionally connected to her sister 
                                Nessarose.  Elphaba is shown to be a highly intelligent person striving 
                                for equal rights for the people.  She is harassed and targeted by those 
                                around her due to her looks and beliefs.
