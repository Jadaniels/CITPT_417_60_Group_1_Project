                                Humans and androids crowd the raucous streets of New Beijing. 
                                A deadly plague ravages the population. From space, a ruthless 
                                lunar people watch, waiting to make their move. No one knows that 
                                Earth's fate hinges on one girl. . . .

                                 with a mysterious past, reviled by her stepmother and blamed for her
                                  stepsister's illness. But when her life becomes intertwined with the
                                   handsome Prince Kai's, she suddenly finds herself at the center of 
                                   an intergalactic struggle, and a forbidden attraction. Caught between

                                Easy to read, imaginative, and sets the stage for the follow on books 
                                that integrate stories that you are familiar, but did not know share 
                                the same universe.

                                Cinder is the first of a series of books by Marissa 
                                Meyer.  It is a different take of the popular Cinderella story.  
                                The story is set in an alternative universe similar to ours.  
                                Magic and technology is present.  Magic being used by Lunar people 
                                while Earth people rely on technology.  The world as post-apocalyptic 
                                with a large divide between the "haves" and "haves not".  Cinder is an 
                                enduring tomboy that captures your heart.  She is faced with a horrible 
                                family life with her younger sister and artificial intelligent robot 
                                being her only comfort.  In the beginning of the story, she is enamored 
                                by a young man and throughout the story the plot is expanded across the 
                                globe.  Her involvement exposes political secrets, government 
                                conspiracies, and an adventure that keeps you wanting to read more.

                                The Myth: Alice was an ordinary girl who stepped through the looking glass 
                                and entered a fairy-tale world invented by Lewis Carroll in his famous 
                                storybook. The Truth: Wonderland is real. Alyss Heart is the heir to the 
                                throne, until her murderous aunt Redd steals the crown and kills Alyss? 
                                parents. To escape Redd, Alyss and her bodyguard, Hatter Madigan, must flee 
                                to our world through the Pool of Tears. But in the pool Alyss and Hatter 
                                are separated. Lost and alone in Victorian London, Alyss is befriended by 
                                an aspiring author to whom she tells the violent, heartbreaking story of 
                                her young life. Yet he gets the story all wrong. Hatter Madigan knows the 
                                truth only too well, and he is searching every corner of our world to find 
                                the lost princess and return her to Wonderland so she may battle Redd for 
                                her rightful place as the Queen of Hearts.

                                A wonderful retelling of what happens when an author takes creative 
                                licensing to a story.  The story entices you to read more and follow 
                                on to the remaining of the series where maybe Queen Redd is not as bad 
                                of a person you thought she was.

                                I was very intrigued by The Looking 
                                Glass Wars.  The cover and artwork is reminisce to Star Wars.  Alyss 
                                is heir to the throne and escapes the castle through the Pool of Tears 
                                into London when her aunt lays siege.  She is alone and is taking in 
                                by a family and her story is changed to a fairy tale for all to read.  
                                While those around her brainwash her that it is all a dream, her 
                                comrades' fight a rebellion for her kingdom.  Her retainer, Hatter 
                                Madigan searches the world to find Alyss after being separated in transit.   
                                Dodge, the son of the original captain of the palace guards along with General 
                                Doppelganger create the Alyssian rebellion.  They struggle for thirteen years 
                                battling against Queen Redd and The Cat until Alyss and Madigan return to 
                                take the throne back.  Deception, loss, and finally resolution are gained, 
                                as Alyss becomes the "Warrior-Queen" to rule Wonderland.
